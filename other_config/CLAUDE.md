- try to make things simple.  try to use fewer lines of code, and more straightforward code when possible as long as we dont have to sacrifice functionality

- if there is a sufficiently tricky issue, its okay to add some debug printing and re-run vs trying to guess the solution

- in python, avoid local/defered imports unless they're strictly necessary or asked for

- when adding tests, try to be judicious about how many we add.  Adding too many tests can lead to excssive change-detection
